## Notes

1. The database uses simplified color names (e.g., "Navy" instead of "Navy Blue" or "Dark Navy")
2. Generic terms like "Green" and "Purple" might represent multiple specific shades from the expected list
3. Each tie style (Bow Ties, Regular Ties, Skinny Ties, Ties 2.75") has variants in all 8 current colors
4. The database structure supports color variants through the `product_variants` table with a `color` field
